Streamline NDA SDK Sample 2.0.0 Release Notes

Notes:
  - This version of the sample adds DLSS-G support to the public repo
  - This version has been extensively rewritten for SL 2.0 and to add support for a wider range of DLSSv3 features.

Known Issues:
  - With all DLSS features enabled, switching to fullscreen via Alt-Enter can cause a hang.  This is being tracked: however, it seems limited to the sample, which runs at a high frame rate, higher than any game.

Streamline SDK Sample 1.1.2 Release Notes

Notes:
  - The sample has been updated to the latest SL 1.1.2 SDK APIs.
  - Full Reflex support has been added to the sample.
  - SL DLL sign-checking has been expanded, and the new -noSigCheck command-line option has been added, which allows the user to disable the checking even in release builds
  - The pre-UI color buffer is now copied and tagged
  - When DLSS is off, we now correctly set the mode to off in the plugin settings, rather than simply not calling the evaluate function.

Streamline SDK Sample 1.1.1 Release Notes

Notes:
  - In this version, the FPS Cap has been enabled at 60Hz by default because the sample runs at such a high frame rate on modern GPUs.  This can be changed or disabled via the UI if desired.
  - The UI for changing the DLSS resolution in dynamic mode has been switched from a 2 sec timer to a button in the UI to trigger the size change
  - The sample now calls Reflex present markers.  See the sample code for details and limitations of these new markers.
  - VSync is now off by default.  To enable it, run with the command-line option `-vsync`
